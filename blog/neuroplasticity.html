  <h1>Neuroplasticity & Growth Mindset</h1>

  <h2>
    Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt, while a growth
    mindset is the belief that abilities can be developed through effort and
    learning,
  </h2>
  <h2>
    Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people.
  </h2>
  <p>
    Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people in alot of
    ways such as: <br />
    Enhance learning & skill development Knowing that the brain can adapt and
    grow encourages people to embrace lifelong learning.<br />
    Overcoming Challenges and adversity Learning a new skill such as coding is
    one thing.<br />
    but being able to overcome the challenges that comes with it is another.<br />
    understanding neuroplasticity helps me become more resillient and avoid
    negative thinking.<br />
    By understandinmg neuroplasticity, people can improve their mental
    adaptability and overall well-being.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
    benefit.
  </h2>
  <p>
    As a Devacademy student, I can use it to enchance my learning by
    consistently writing code, solving challenges and revisiting key concepts
    over time. Prioritizing healthy habits such as getting good sleep, eating
    healthy and also exercise i believe would also makes things alot easier for
    me.
  </p>

  <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h2>

  <h2>Rest/Sleep</h2>

  <p>
    Just like weightlifting the muscles grow on the rest days not during the
    training sessions. same with our brain when trying to learn.
  </p>

  <h2>Repetition</h2>
  <p>
    The use it or lose it principle, if you want to be good or get better at
    something do it all the time. because when the neural connection isn't
    actively used it can weaken or diminish over time. so coding 1 hour a day
    every week is better than coding 7 hours in one day.

  <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>

  <h2>Growth mindset what is it? why is it relevant?</h2>
  <p>
    Growth mindset is the belief that abilities and intelligence can develop
    through effort, learning and persistence.<br />its the opposite of fixed
    mindset, where people see skills as innate and unchangeable.<br />

    Its important as it helps you focus on your own improvement rather than
    focusing on reaching a goal. its about trusting and enjoying the process.
  </p>

  <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>

  <p>
    Im just surprised of the amounts of research people have done about this
    topic.<br />change ? not much, I believe I already have that "growth mindset
    traits" thats why I'm here. <br />All of us in my Cohort have it.
  </p>

  <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>

  <p>
    When I enrolled in Devacademy the main reason is i wanted to work in a tech
    industry job. <br />I was more excited about finishing the course than
    starting it. <br />but now with JavaScript being this hard. I'll take it
    sprint by sprint.
  </p>

  <h2>
    Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
    learning plan and strategy.
  </h2>

  <p>I will focus more on the process "the now" than focusing on "end goal"</p>

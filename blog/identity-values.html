    Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how you
    weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made, and
    how you reflect on the decision now. Describe how your culture and the
    people around you have influenced your values and identity. Identify your
    strengths and how they will support you during your learning journey.
    Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career development.
    How might these affect your learning journey? Share an example of when you
    were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or
    tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were,
    and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.

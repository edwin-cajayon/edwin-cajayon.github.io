      <h1>Identity & Values</h1>
      <h2>
        Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss how
        you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
        made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
      </h2>

      <p>
        Yes I make ethical decisions everyday. specially if you're driving
        around auckland<br />
        people will cut you off, honk at you, overtake you unsafely.<br />
        tail-gate you and park their car so close you cant get in your car. but
        instead of getting back at them. I just say "Oh well".
      </p>

      <h2>
        how your culture and the people around you have influenced your values
        and identity.
      </h2>

      <p>
        My parents played a massive role in my identity and values.<br />
        They sacrificed alot of things to get to where am I now.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Identify your strengths and how they will support you during your
        learning journey. Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning
        and career development.
      </h2>

      <p>
        My biggest strength would be my "just show up" mindset.<br />I like to
        build a routine and follow it for years.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Evaluate your limitations in terms of your learning and career
        development. How might these affect your learning journey?
      </h2>

      <p>my ability to stay focus would be my biggest limitations</p>

      <h2>
        Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with
        others, but there was resistance or tension.
      </h2>

      <p>
        There was this one time my team at work were behind schedule for the
        "kainga ora" housing. <br />
        it was winter time so some of my team we're sick and the machines we
        we're using keeps on breaking down.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and
        your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.
      </h2>

      <p>
        We stand on business. instead of rushing, i told my team to not take
        shorcuts and we worked extra hours and weekends that time.

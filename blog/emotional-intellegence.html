    <h1>What is emotional intelligence?</h1>

    <p>
      Emotional Intelligence is being aware of my own emotions and being able to
      read the emotions of ther people. Which helps you to dive deeper into
      intuition.
    </p>

    <h2>For me there are 4 components of Emotional Intelligence:</h2>

    <h2>
      1. Self awareness - how aware you are of what you feeling when and why.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      2. Self Management- How actively you're able to manage you emotions and
      behaveiour with purpose and intent.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      3. Social awareness - How aware you are of what others are feeling when
      and why.
    </h2>

    <h2>
      4. Social Management - How actively you're able to act to address other
      people's emotions effectively and intentionally.
    </h2>

    <p>
      At its core, Its about understanding and managine emotions, both my own
      andothers, in a way that strenghthens relationships instead of wrecking
      them. It's not just being empathetic and sensitive. its knowing when to
      express emotions, when to step back. and knowing how to navigate tough
      situations without letting emotions run wild.
    </p>

    <h1>How is EQ Different to IQ?</h1>
    <p>
      Think EQ and IQ like two different types of "smartness": EQ - is about
      understanding emotions- both my own and other people's. It helps you
      handle feelings, get along with others, and react the right way in
      different situations. IQ - is about how well you think, solve problems and
      understand things like math, logic, and facts. It helps you do well in
      school, figure out puzzles, and learn new things quickly. So, IQ is like
      being good at solving a Rubik's Cube, and EQ is like knowing when to cheer
      up a sad friend. both are important in life.
    </p>
    <h1>Why EQ is important ?</h1>

    <p>
      EQ is VERY important in our life. As a friend - It helps you understand
      their feelings and know when they're happy, sad or upset - It helps you to
      become a good listener and support them when they need help - It helps you
      avoid unneccesary fights by staying calm and solving problems instead of
      overreacting. - Its helps you make strong, lasting friendships because
      people feel comfortable around you. As an employee - It helps you work
      well with others, which is important in any job. - It helps you stay calm
      under pressure, making it easier to handle stress and deadlines. - It
      helps you to communicate clearly, avoids misunderstandings. - It helps you
      to handle critism well, using feedback to improve instead of getting
      upset. - It helps you become a great leader because people trust and
      respect those who understand emotions. In short, Eq helps you build good
      relationships, avoid drama, and succeed in life both personally and
      professionally.

  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <h2>That one time I was blocked by a simple Problem</h2>

  <p>
    I would say all of JS kata. specially the Gradebook and super flipflop. I
    was overthinking every thing during both of those challenges.
  </p>

  <h2>That one time were I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
  <p>
    During the JS methods challenge I find it really awesome that during that
    challenge. even though i get stuck. I kind of know what do to. Like i dont
    feel lost the I did during JS Kata challenge.

    Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you
    reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I'm always reluctant to ask for help. because im just shy and i feel like
    people are already dealing with their own challenge why add more to it ? But
    maybe i should change try and change that atitude.

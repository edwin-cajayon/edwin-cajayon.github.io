  <h1>Problem Solving</h1>
  <h2>That one time I was blocked by a simple Problem</h2>

  <h2>What was the problem?</h2>
  <p>
    In Gradebook challenge, I got stuck on the
    <strong>enterScores</strong> function because I didn't releaize the
    gradebook object need a nested structure. I tried looping each assigned
    student's scores array directly in to their name. instead of nesting them in
    objects with a <strong>testScores</strong> key.
  </p>

  <h2>What problem-solving techniques did you use ?</h2>
  <p>
    I went ahead and google "why isn't my object working in javascript?" I went
    down the rabbit hole. I also Ask Grok to review my code and make a lesson
    with it.
  </p>

  <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
  <p>
    Started confident, got frustrated fast, felt dumb when stuck, then relieved
    after Googling.
  </p>

  <h2>That one time were I elegantly solved a problem</h2>
  <h2>What was the problem ?</h2>
  <p>
    In gradebook challenge. The problem-solving tenchinque i used is googling
    the problem learned about object literals and tested it.
  </p>
  <h2>How did you feel throughout the process?</h2>
  <p>Stressed at first. but happy when I got it working.</p>

  <h2>Rubber ducky method | 7/10</h2>
  <h2>Reading error messages | 6/10</h2>
  <h2>Console.logging | 5/10</h2>

  <h2>
    Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you
    reluctant to do so. What might you try differently next time?
  </h2>
  <p>
    I'm always reluctant to ask for help. because im just shy and i feel like
    people are already dealing with their own challenge why add more to it ? But
    maybe i should change try and change that atitude.

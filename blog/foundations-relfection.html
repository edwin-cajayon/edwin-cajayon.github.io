    <h2>
      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
      First, human skills helped me focus more on listening, learning and collaborating with others rather than needing to appaer capable all the time.<br>
      Second, being kinder to myself when it comes to learning. Struggling with javascript really challenged my confidence. human skills taught me to be more compassionate with my self and to see growth as a process not a race. <br>
      Lastly, I realised I tend to compare my progess to other. When i saw others picking up the thingds faster, I felt behind or not good enough. Human skills helped me catch those thoughts and remind myself that everyone learns differently.<br>
    </p>

    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>

    <p></p>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about the Human Skills learning?</h2>

    <p>
      What surprised me the most is how impactful it is. In learning and In
      life. That to be successful its not all tech stuff.
    </p>

    <h2>
      What were the most challenging aspects of the Human Skills learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Hmmm, Nothing to be honest. Every topic discuss in human skills made sense
      to me and made me a better learner.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on Human Skills learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>

    <p>
      because to be a successful developer being able to write code is only half
      the battle. having a healthty mindset and being able to work well with my
      team will greatly improve my skills as a developer. but also the team.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying Human Skills learning here feel like a
      waste of time?
    </h2>

    <p>
      Not at all. I like studying human skills learning. its the calm away from
      the chaos of javascript. I always liked the human skills part of
      foundations.

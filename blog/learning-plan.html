      <h1>The Learning plan</h1>

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to pivot my career into tech. <br />Im truly
        greatful on what i have accomplished so far in my current career but<br />Its
        not something I would like to do moving forward.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>

      <p>
        I would say my strenghts are being able to show up everyday.<br />to do
        the things i wanna be better at. like my weightlifting and my Muay Thai
        training.<br />I would like to apply the same discipline to this.
        <br />My limitations would probably be my sleepiness. i sleep alot.
      </p>

      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My Job requires me to work for 40 hours a week. 6AM to 2:30PM.<br />I
        will give atleast 20 hours or more to study every week.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        I like to solve problems on my own which is a weekness at this point.<br />I
        would like to just google it first before asking another person for
        help.

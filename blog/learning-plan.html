      <h1>Learning Plan (Bootcamp)</h1>

      <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a software developer and build a solid
        career in tech. I want to work on projects that actually help people and
        keep pushing my skills forward. I’m shifting away from my old industry
        because I want something that challenges me mentally and gives me more
        room to grow and create.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
        Bootcamp?
      </h2>
      <p>
        One of my biggest strengths is showing up consistently. I’ve built that
        habit through training Muay Thai and lifting — and I bring that same
        energy into learning. I also stay calm under pressure and just keep
        going.<br /><br />
        A limitation I’ve noticed is that I can be too independent. I try to
        figure everything out on my own, which slows me down sometimes. I’m
        working on asking for help sooner and not being afraid to speak up when
        I’m stuck. Also, I tend to get pretty sleepy after work — so staying
        focused will be a challenge I need to manage carefully.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
        be?
      </h2>
      <p>
        My biggest non-technical challenge will be staying focused and energised
        after a full day of work. I’m still working 6AM to 2:30PM, so jumping
        straight into study mode afterwards can be tough. I’ll also need to push
        myself to speak up more in group situations and be okay with not always
        having the right answer.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What non-technical (human) skills would you like to develop while at Dev
        Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I’d like to get better at communicating and working in teams. I’m
        naturally independent, so learning to ask for help and give helpful
        feedback is something I want to work on. I also want to feel more
        confident pairing and collaborating with others.
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h2>
      <p>
        I don’t expect the Bootcamp team to solve problems for me, but I do
        appreciate support that points me in the right direction when I’m stuck.
        Honest feedback and encouragement go a long way. I also value a space
        where it feels safe to be real about what I’m struggling with.
      </p>

      <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h2>
      <p>
        I expect myself to show up every day with a good attitude, even when
        things get hard. I want to stay open-minded, stay curious, and not be
        afraid to make mistakes. I also want to support others and be someone
        that contributes positively to the team.
      </p>

      <h1>The Learning plan (Foundations)</h1>

      <h2>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h2>
      <p>
        My long term goal is to pivot my career into tech. <br />Im truly
        greatful on what i have accomplished so far in my current career but<br />Its
        not something I would like to do moving forward.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to
        learning
      </h2>

      <p>
        I would say my strenghts are being able to show up everyday.<br />to do
        the things i wanna be better at. like my weightlifting and my Muay Thai
        training.<br />I would like to apply the same discipline to this.
        <br />My limitations would probably be my sleepiness. i sleep alot.
      </p>

      <h2>
        What skills (non-technical/human skills) would you like to see developed
        in yourself while at Dev Academy?
      </h2>
      <p>
        I would like to be more team oriented when it comes to solving problems
        and challenges.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
      </h2>
      <p>
        My Job requires me to work for 40 hours a week. 6AM to 2:30PM.<br />I
        will give atleast 20 hours or more to study every week.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
      </h2>
      <p>
        I like to solve problems on my own which is a weekness at this point.<br />I
        would like to just google it first before asking another person for
        help.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the moment all of the facilitators are helpful and understanding.
        They are all awesome.

    <h1>JavaScript & DOM</h1>

    <h2>
      An analogy that describes JavaScript and its relationship with HTML and
      CSS
    </h2>
    <p>
      I, Myself also had a hard time when thinking of the relationship of JS to
      HTML & CSS. but what certainly help me understand their relationship with
      each other is comparing them to their real world counter parts. sort of.
    </p>

    <h2>Car analogy</h2>
    <p>
      HTML is the car's frame and Chassis. CSS would be the paint job, body kit,
      seat covers and dashboard. and JavaScript would be the Engine and the ECU
      of the car.
    </p>
    <h2>A Coffee Shop analogy</h2>
    <p>
      Now here HTML would be layout of the shop. the tables and chairs the
      counter and MENU. CSS would be the interior design of the shop. The LOGO,
      Curtains, The paint. And JavaScript would be the baristas making Coffee,
      The cashier and servers.
    </p>
    <h2>And Lastly Human body analogy</h2>
    <p>
      the most easiest analogy i could think of, HTML would be the skeleton. CSS
      is our Skin, hair and clothing. and JavaScript would be the Brain and
      Muscle.
    </p>

    <h1>Control Flow</h1>
    <p>
      Unlike us humans, when we do a task we already know what is what and which
      is which. Computers do not. Control flow is the order in which
      instructions are executed. If Im gonna ask my computer to make me a coffee
      heres what it would look like
    </p>

    <h1>Loops</h1>
    <p>
      Loops helps us repeat action multiple times. so we dont have to write a
      code everytime we want to repeat an action. if I want to stri my coffee in
      JavaScript code it would look like this
    </p>

    <h1>The DOM</h1>
    <p>
      Think of DOM as a TREE where the root is the document itself â€” the
      webpage. Each node in this tree represents a different element or section
      of the document. The branches connecting these nodes show relationships,
      such as parent-child connections.
    </p>

    <h1>Arrays</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays are big box that you can fit alot of stuff in. like the image
      below.
    </p>

    <h1>Objects</h1>
    <p>
      In real-life its basically like a contact card.Each piece of information
      (name, age, phone number) is paired with a label (the key) that describes
      the information, and the actual details (MCLOVIN, HAWAII, etc.) are the
      values.
    </p>
    <img src="../photos/Objectsmclovin.jpg" class="jsdom" />
    <p>In JavaScript code it would look something like this.</p>
    <img src="../photos/driverlicense.jpg" class="jsdom" />
    <h1>Functions</h1>
    <p>
      They are basically a recipe for your favorite egg. Instead of writing down
      all the steps everytime you want to make one, you write a recipe once and
      just follow it whenever you want to cook.
